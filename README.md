# rx Responsive Menu

It's a Flex based Framework that has been created after researching lots of other CSS Frameworks. I have added several classes according to my work platform. I have used many other CSS Libraries, but nobody gives the full layout covered classes. So I have generated my own Framework. It has not been created in one day, it has taken almost a year to full phase complete. So use rx CSS Framework and create blazingly fast websites.
